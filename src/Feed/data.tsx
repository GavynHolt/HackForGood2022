<p>The wellness wheel is a visual aid that shows each category of wellness on a wheel. It gives people the opportunity to hone in on their wellness by identifying areas in their life they may have neglected and work toward improvement. Since all of the dimensions are interconnected, an imbalance in one area of the wellness wheel might restrict you from reaching peak wellbeing. It&#8217;s important to remember that wellness is not only important for your physical and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/why-is-mental-health-important/">mental health</a>, but for all aspects of your life.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>What is a Wellness Wheel?</h2>



<p>The wellness wheel is a tool for self exploration that promotes the concept that balance is the key to wellbeing. When it was first conceived by Dr. Bill Hettler, he outlined six dimensions of wellness as markers to help individuals accomplish a well rounded, healthy lifestyle and live a life of value and meaning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, the wheel has grown to include seven categories. Today, the dimensions on the wellness wheel include: physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual, environmental, social, and occupational wellness. These are all separate yet interconnected categories that contribute to reaching a balanced life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use the wellness wheel periodically to reflect on your progress over time, and it can help you understand what lifestyle changes you may want to start making. By honing in on each area, you will be able to improve the overall quality of your life, better your health, and work towards your full potential. Read on to learn more about each category of the wellness wheel.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>1. Physical Wellness</h2>



<p>The physical dimension of the wellness wheel refers to the physical health of your body. It involves all types of physical activities, nutrition and balanced diets, sleep, strength, and tending to your health with medical care when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staying on top of your yearly checkups, exercising regularly, and eating balanced meals are also part of your physical wellness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Talkspace therapist </em><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/elizabethkeohan/"><em>Elizabeth Keohan, LCSW-C, LICSW, LCSW</em></a> has some helpful tips for working on your physical wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Write down your goals</strong> — Planning for movement is just as important as planning that oil change. It’s easier to follow through when we have visual reminders.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Find a workout buddy </strong>— Not only will it encourage you to exercise, but you’ll catch up with a friend as an added bonus.</li><li><strong>Find an incentive </strong>—<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Having a goal can eliminate ambivalence and help increase motivation. These can be fluid and don’t have to be expensive. Sometimes, even just a fancy latte can help ignite a new routine!</li><li><strong>Start small </strong>— Remind yourself that a mile in any form is still one mile! Cumulative effort is more sustainable and impactful for long term commitment.</li><li><strong>Diversify </strong>—<strong> </strong>Too much of anything influences us to lose steam but changing things up keeps things fun and light.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>2. Emotional Wellness</h2>



<p>Emotional Wellness refers to your feelings and emotions. What are your emotional reactions like? Are you in tune with your feelings so that you can understand and express them? With a strong foundation in <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/emotional-health-definition/">emotional health</a>, you leave yourself better equipped to adapt to any of life’s changes and cope with stress.</p>



<p>Take care of your emotional wellness by sleeping enough, speaking to a therapist when you can, asking for help when you’re in need, and regularly checking in with yourself to manage your overall stress.</p>



<p><em>Talkspace therapist </em><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/reshawna-chapple/"><em>Reshawna Chapple, PhD, LCSW</em></a> has some helpful tips for working on your emotional wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Acknowledge your feelings — </strong>Check in with yourself and see how you’re really feeling. It is ok to take time and cry or to be sad.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Start a self-care routine —</strong> Use meditation, grounding activities, yoga, stretching, or breathing exercises to calm your body and your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be realistic when you are not feeling 100% —</strong> Certain times of the year may be more stressful than others (like holidays). It is important to prioritize your mental health especially when you are not feeling your best — even if that means saying no to some things. You deserve to take care of yourself.</li><li><strong>Reach out —</strong> If you feel lonely or isolated, seek out family and friends, a religious group, online support groups, or virtual events.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Learn to say no —</strong> Saying yes when you want to say no can leave you feeling resentful and overwhelmed. Having clear boundaries is a way to show yourself respect and care, and it can be a helpful way to prevent resentments from building.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>3. Intellectual Wellness&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The intellectual wellness dimension focuses on lifelong learning, broadening your knowledge, and building skills. It encourages you to stay curious, learn, and take part in creative activities to ensure your mind stays healthy and active.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reading for pleasure, staying updated on social and political issues, or mentoring individuals are all things that would fall under intellectual wellness.</p>



<p>Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/ashley-ertel/">Ashley Ertel, LCSW, BCD (She/Her/Hers)</a> has some helpful tips for prioritizing your intellectual wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Join a book club! — </strong>Book clubs are a great way to keep you accountable for reading while also taking part in a social group activity. If you don’t live near your fellow bookworm friends, create a recurring Zoom hangout.</li><li><strong>Create a list of topics that interest you</strong> — To help with your intellectual wellness, keep track of a list of interesting topics and spend some time each month researching the topic further.</li><li><strong>Get involved</strong> — See how you can contribute to your community by getting involved in a local political, educational, or social organization.</li><li><strong>Take time daily to write</strong> — Writing down your thoughts and ideas in a wonderful way to stimulate your intellectual mind.</li><li><strong>Practice problem solving</strong> — Keep your mind sharp by regularly practicing your problem solving skills, you can start with logic puzzles or games.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>4. Spiritual Wellness</h2>



<p>The spiritual wellness dimension refers to the beliefs, values, and ethics that guide you through life and inform your actions. It asks you to look inwards and explore your purpose and meaning in life through the spiritual lens to find peace. Spiritual wellness provides an opportunity for many to engage with a force greater than themselves and tap into communities, whether that be through a religion or by practicing mindfulness or meditation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/meaghan-rice/"><em>Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC</em></a> provides five helpful tips for prioritizing your spiritual wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Make spirituality part of your routine</strong> — Waking up 5-10 minutes earlier in the mornings to meditate could add a bit more of a spiritual, calm mindset into your day.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Connect with others — </strong>Be part of a community, either virtually or in-person, that shares the same spiritual beliefs.</li><li><strong>Find momentos —</strong> Have momentos that represent your spiritual journey and keep them where you will see them often.</li><li><strong>Design a vision board — </strong>Vision boards are a great way to keep track of your goals and encompass how far you have come in your spirituality.</li><li><strong>Celebrate —</strong> Significant milestones are meant to be celebrated, and it’s no different in our spiritual journey!</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>5. Environmental Wellness</h2>



<p>The environmental wellness dimension refers to the role of your surroundings in your overall well being. From a micro level within your own home environment to a global scale, our <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/physical-environment-mental-health/">physical environment impacts our mental health</a> and has a massive impact on our mood and how we live our lives. Environmental wellness is concerned with the way you interact with your environment such as your home, school, or workspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decluttering a room, recycling the trash, or emptying the dishwasher are all small ways we can contribute to promoting a clutter-free, cleaner, organized, and more productive living space and calm home environment. Staying environmentally conscious by educating yourself about global environmental issues, taking care of the environment, and creating spaces that are conducive to positive emotions are other ways to focus on your environmental wellness.</p>



<p>Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/ashley-ertel/"><em>Ashley Ertel, LCSW, BCD</em> (<em>She/Her/Hers)</em></a><em> </em>provides five helpful tips for prioritizing your environmental wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Research clean alternatives — </strong>Find cleaner alternatives to some of your commonly used household supplies.</li><li><strong>Spend time outside —</strong> Time in the outdoors is healing in so many ways and can help bring us closer to nature.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use natural light</strong> — When possible, use natural light to create a calmer and more productive environment. Benefits associated with natural light include its ability to ward off seasonal depression symptoms, improve sleep, and relieve stress.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Make the switch to reusable products —</strong> Start small, like opting to use your own coffee mug instead of getting a disposable one from your local coffee shop.</li><li><strong>Consider taking up gardening</strong> — Even if it’s only a couple of apartment-friendly house plants.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>6. Social Wellness</h2>



<p>The social wellness dimension of the wellness wheel refers to the quality of your relationships with others. Keeping a strong network of people that you feel connected to is key to your social wellness and can help fend off feelings of stress, isolation, loneliness, or even depression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participating in group activities alongside family or friends, joining organizations, being open to new connections, and respecting and nourishing meaningful relationships is key to healthy social wellness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/reshawna-chapple/"><em>Reshawna Chapple, PhD, LCSW</em></a><em> </em>provides five helpful tips for prioritizing your social wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Set Boundaries</strong> — We live in a fast-paced world with many societal pressures. Sometimes we act based on the way we think others will perceive us and do things we might not actually want to do. Setting boundaries creates trust and builds healthy relationships. It also improves self-esteem.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Try to limit your consumption of news and social media</strong> — Too much news and social media can be overwhelming and have an impact on our stress levels. Consider removing notifications on your apps, and consider muting or blocking anyone who causes you undo stress.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Process your own feelings</strong> — Allow yourself to be vulnerable and resist the urge to minimize your feelings. Even if your friends don’t understand what you’re going through, set time aside to reflect on your thoughts. Speak with a therapist, spiritual advisor or emotionally safe support systems.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Plan ahead — </strong>Schedule activities that you can look forward to. Set aside specific days for cooking, shopping, baking, chores, and connecting with friends and other activities.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Engage in activities that increase joy and reduce stress — </strong>Examples include: playing games, doing puzzles, watching movies, gardening, art, reading, exercising, or even taking a nap.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>7. Occupational Wellness</h2>



<p>Occupational wellness, also known as financial wellness, is the dimension that refers to the fulfillment you find in your work and how financial stability works itself into your life.&nbsp; By considering your job satisfaction, finances, and career ambitions, you can evaluate your occupational wellness in this dimension. Budgeting, keeping financial health in mind, and finding the right job for you all fall under occupational wellness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talkspace therapist <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/meaghan-rice/"><em>Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC</em></a><em> </em>provides five helpful tips for prioritizing your occupational wellness:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Separate work from home</strong> — Don’t let work responsibilities and your home life overlap too much. If you work from home, try to create a separate space for working hours, like a desk or workstation that you can leave when you want to unwind or spend time with loved ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Connect socially</strong> — It’s important to feel connected to your coworkers. A great way to socialize and get to know each other better is by catching up during breaks or having lunch together.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ask for feedback </strong>—<strong> </strong>Ask your supervisor to give you feedback on a regular basis, not just during a performance evaluation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Take mental health days </strong>– Remember to check in with yourself in order to avoid burnout and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-talk-to-boss-about-mental-health/">talk to your boss about your mental health.</a> A day off every once in a while can boost our productivity and allow us the time and space to focus on our mental health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Communicate —</strong> Talk to your coworkers and supervisors about how you’re really doing at work, and don’t be afraid to ask for additional support when needed.</li></ol>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>How to Set Wellness Goals &amp; Create a Plan</h2>



<p>If you’re serious about setting wellness goals, go back and consider all seven dimensions of wellness and reflect on how you relate to each in your life. What, if anything, could you be doing better in each respective section? Is there a certain area you’re struggling in more than others?&nbsp; A good question to ask yourself is why. Why do you feel a certain imbalance in your wellness wheel? This practice will help you gain more clarity into the wellness aspects that you’ve prioritized and others that you might have overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’ve asked and answered your “why,” you will be better set to form an action plan and choose the practices you want to introduce into your daily routine. It’s best not to try to accomplish everything all at once; that can be too overwhelming. Start small and begin to make little adjustments in each category. Create a realistic plan that you can stick to in order to find balance in each area and boost your wellbeing.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>When to Seek Professional Guidance</h2>



<p>The goal of the wellness wheel is to check in with yourself, evaluate how you are doing, and highlight any imbalances that might be preventing you from living a happy and healthy life. The wellness wheel prompts introspection, self-reflection, and should lead to goal-setting. This work is hard and it can be beneficial to work alongside a counselor, life coach, or therapist to help you unpack any feelings that come up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a therapist or counselor can help you with life adjustments, goal setting, and taking the necessary steps to accomplish what you set out to achieve. A therapist can also help you process emotions and patterns that might be stopping you from reaching your full potential. Working with a professional to gain additional guidance is a huge benefit when it comes to our personal wellness journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wellness wheel is a tool that individuals can utilize periodically to reflect on their progress over time, and it can clarify any lifestyle changes they want to start making. By honing in on each area, you will be able to improve the overall quality of your life, better your health, and work towards your full potential. Read on to learn more about each category of the wellness wheel.</p>

<p>Stress vs anxiety — how are they different? Although stress and anxiety are both marked by abnormal brain activity and cause similar biological and behavioral responses, they’re actually clinically distinct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stress is the body&#8217;s reaction to external threats and societal pressures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic anxiety is a mental health condition that affects <a href="https://adaa.org/">more than 40 million adult Americans</a> and results from irrational and unrealistic threats.</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper into the difference between stress and anxiety. We’ll explain how to tell apart one from the other, exploring the symptoms and triggers, and offering practical advice about seeking professional help to deal with either.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Symptoms of Stress and Anxiety</h2>



<p>Stress and anxiety both have a wide range of psychological, physiological, and physical symptoms. Some of them — like rapid breathing, upset stomach, constipation, diarrhea, rapid heartbeat, and an inability to relax — overlap and can be present in both conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that both stress and anxiety are natural human responses that have a purpose. They warn us about danger or try to keep us safe. A major difference, however, is that stress is typically a short-term response to a recognized threat. Anxiety is more enduring, and it can sometimes be difficult to discern what&#8217;s causing it.</p>



<p>Stress and anxiety only become problematic when they&#8217;re chronic or excessively intense. In reality, they can be beneficial to our health and well-being when experienced in small doses over short periods.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s examine some of the symptoms of stress vs anxiety separately.</p>



<h3>Symptoms of stress</h3>



<p>Some of the most common symptoms of stress include:</p>



<ul><li>Nausea</li><li>Dizziness</li><li>Dry mouth</li><li>Headache</li><li>Sweaty palms</li><li>Chest pain (angina)</li><li>Rapid breathing</li></ul>



<p>Stress can also often cause you to feel overwhelmed, moody, or irritable.</p>



<h3>Symptoms of anxiety</h3>



<p>Some of the most common <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/anxiety-symptoms-signs-guide-tips-what-is/">symptoms of anxiety</a> include:</p>



<ul><li>Tense muscles</li><li>Being easily startled</li><li>Numbness or tingling in the hands and feet</li><li>Consistent feelings of dread or impending doom</li></ul>



<p>Anxiety can cause you to feel restless and jittery. It may also make falling or staying asleep difficult.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Causes Of Stress vs. Anxiety</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/causes/">causes of anxiety</a> and stress are known as “triggers.” Anxiety can be caused by a combination of environmental factors, genetics, and chemical imbalances that are unique to each individual. Excessively entertaining negative thoughts can also exacerbate generalized anxiety. Comparatively, stress is triggered by outside factors.</p>



<h3>Stress triggers&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stress symptoms can be triggered by external life events such as:</p>



<ul><li>Dealing with major pressures like work deadlines and professional presentations</li><li>Significant life changes like getting married, buying a new property, a death</li><li>Feeling out of control about the outcome of important situations</li><li>Being at odds with somebody you love</li><li>Common everyday worries</li></ul>



<p>It’s important to understand that there doesn&#8217;t need to be a single powerful stressor that&#8217;s causing you to feel stressed. Stress can result from various small triggers over time.</p>



<h3>Anxiety triggers</h3>



<p>Anxiety in small doses is healthy and keeps us alert and aware of potential threats around us. It changes our senses and prepares us for survival. For instance, maybe you feel anxious while walking down a dark city street. That feeling is healthy. It prepares you to fight or flee. It&#8217;s your survival instinct at work.</p>



<p>However, when anxiety is chronic and excessive, it can lead to various mental health conditions and anxiety disorders, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/generalized-anxiety-disorder-guide-signs-symptoms-treatments-what-is/">generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/cbt-for-social-anxiety/">social anxiety disorder (SAD)</a>, panic disorder, and <a data-wpil="url" href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a>, to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the most common triggers for anxiety can include:</p>



<ul><li>Conflict with people at work, family members, or romantic partners</li><li>Chronic insomnia or other sleep disturbances</li><li>A serious health diagnosis</li><li>Public speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Long-term financial problems</li><li>Heavy caffeine use</li></ul>



<p>Learning how to anticipate and recognize your triggers can help you to determine the best coping strategies for dealing with your stress and anxiety — but how do you know which one you&#8217;re experiencing at any given time?</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>How to Know If You’re Dealing with Stress or Anxiety</h2>



<p>Knowing the difference between stress and anxiety is easier once you understand more about each condition. Anxiety and stress are both parts of the body&#8217;s natural fight or flight response system, which is controlled by the brain&#8217;s limbic system. When we feel threatened, our bodies release stress hormones. Those hormones cause our heart rate to increase, which results in increased blood circulation to the limbs and organs.</p>



<p><em>The stress response prepares you to either fight or run away from a threat</em>. Your breathing becomes quicker and more shallow. Your blood pressure rises. At the same time, your senses become sharper as the body releases special nutrients into the circulatory system so that the entire body is charged with energy. This stress process happens almost instantaneously, and its effects are powerful.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Anxiety, however, is the body&#8217;s response to the stress process</em>. It’s typically marked by feelings of unease, dread, or distress, like something harmful might happen at any moment. Because each person has different stressors, naturally, there are different <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/different-types-anxiety-disorders-classified/">types of anxiety</a>, like social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, etc.</p>



<p>These responses might kick in when you’re faced with an emotional or physical threat, even if that threat is just imaginary. While the process is necessary for our survival and health, if it happens too often or too intensely, it can cause problems in our daily life.</p>



<p>One of the main ways to tell anxiety from stress is duration. Stress typically self-resolves within a short time. Anxiety can last longer, and its cause is often difficult to discern. If you&#8217;re experiencing repetitive symptoms and can’t tell whether they’re stress or anxiety-related, you might want to consider seeking help from a mental health professional.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Anxiety can be triggered by stress, of course, but it can also resonate internally on its own, without a trigger, due to a perceived or imagined fear. Stress is often linked to a known source such as work, a relationship, or even a challenging situation. Working with clients to identify and manage both can truly empower a growth mindset rather than feeling stalled by dysregulation.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/elizabethkeohan/">Talkspace therapist Elizabeth Keohan, LCSW-C, LICSW, LCSW</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<h2>When Should You Find Help?</h2>



<p>Sometimes, anxiety and stress happen simultaneously, and it can feel very overwhelming. If you’re constantly feeling stressed out or anxious, to the point where it&#8217;s affecting your daily life, you might want to get professional support from a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional. Fortunately, you can find some that are willing to conduct<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/"> online therapy</a>. So you can still get medical advice when you are unable to go in person.</p>



<p>Learning to recognize and anticipate your triggers is an effective strategy you can practice at home. When you learn to spot your triggers as they occur, you can take immediate action to avoid the onset of stress and anxiety symptoms and figure out how to respond during a stressful situation. You can also figure out strategies for effective anxiety or stress management. For instance, you could do deep breathing exercises, meditate, or take a nice relaxing Epsom salt bath.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It can be so helpful to reach out to a trusted support system or a therapist when stress and anxiety start to hamper your daily activities. Increased physical symptoms such as digestive issues, migraines, or headaches and poor sleep can be a sign that you’re not yourself and an indicator that stress and anxiety are getting in the way.”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/elizabethkeohan/">Talkspace therapist Elizabeth Keohan, LCSW-C, LICSW, LCSW</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>You should speak to a doctor or therapist about exploring <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/therapy-treatment-types/">therapy for anxiety</a> if you feel out of control and unable to handle routine life events. Consider seeking professional help if you:</p>



<ul><li>Had a significant change in eating, sleeping, or personal hygiene habits</li><li>Have been thinking about harming yourself or other people</li><li>Have been using alcohol and drugs to numb your feelings</li><li>Are unable to complete your daily work and life tasks</li><li>Always feel in a low mood or depressed</li><li>Are having irrational fears</li></ul>



<p>Remember that chronic stress and anxiety are both very treatable and manageable. Educate yourself about basic, effective coping mechanisms (and other medical advice) and use them daily. With just a few minutes of practice a day, you can retrain your mind and learn to anticipate stress and anxiety triggers before they take hold of your emotions.</p>

<p>Fear and anxiety are similar emotions that often co-occur and are easily mistaken for one another. <em>Fear </em>is a strong biological response to imminent danger. <em>Anxiety </em>is marked by apprehension and worry over things that may or may not occur. Both emotions can feel the same, but there are some important differences to note.</p>



<p>To fully understand the difference between fear and anxiety separately, you must review their similarities <em>and </em>their differences. You can start by exploring the physiological, psychological, and physical symptoms of both emotions. From there, you’ll know how to differentiate between the two as they occur. Finally, it’s also important to know when it might be time to seek professional help if you have a repetitive, extreme fear or a <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/">generalized anxiety disorder</a>.</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Fear and Anxiety?</h2>



<p>There’s a distinct, key difference between fear and anxiety. Fear results from a clear and present danger, while anxiety results from the anticipation of an unspecified threat. Each of these emotions is marked by unique expressions of mental and bodily effects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Fear and anxiety can feel like the same thing as the symptoms are quite similar. While it’s difficult to tease it out at the moment, gaining insight if one is experiencing fear over anxiety is important. Anxiety often stems from an unclear threat, while fear is based around a real and clear threat. It’s not to say that fear and anxiety don’t work together, but that they tap into different triggers.”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/minchung/">Talkspace therapist Minkyung Chung, MS, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<h2>What is Fear?</h2>



<p>Fear is an uncontrollable survival emotion that serves to protect us from real danger. Humans have evolved over time, with their sense of fear intact, to stay alive and safe from harm.</p>



<p>The limbic system is called your “emotional brain.” We experience fear when it’s a perceived threat, like when someone suddenly touches your back, or when you hear an animal running up toward you, or when you smell smoke coming from your child’s bedroom.</p>



<p>Fear can cause marked changes in smell, taste, hearing, touch, and vision — all the senses that provide information about the perceived threat you’re facing. Fear prepares you to either enter into battle or flee for your safety.</p>



<p>The sensation of fear is immediate and beyond your control. What you <em>can</em> control, however, is how you manage fear symptoms. That said, you can’t always stop them from occurring in the first place.</p>



<p>The purpose of fear is to fuel your flight-or-fight fear response to external stimuli. It causes multiple symptoms that are similar to those of anxiety. Let’s take a closer look at the symptoms that fear can cause.</p>
</div></div>



<h3>Signs and Symptoms of Fear</h3>



<p>As emotions go, fear causes some of the most noticeable changes in the brain and body. That’s because we’re forced to pay attention to our fear. Anxiety, on the other hand, is not imperative for survival. That’s why we sometimes don’t feel symptoms of anxiety quite as strongly or instantly as we might experience fear.</p>



<p>There are some common physiological, psychological, and physical symptoms of fear.</p>



<p><strong>Physiological symptoms of fear:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Quick, shallow breathing</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Hot flashes or chills</li><li>Rapid heartbeat</li><li>Upset stomach</li><li>Goosebumps</li><li>Tight chest</li><li>Dry mouth</li><li>Trembling</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Nausea</li></ul>



<p><strong>Psychological symptoms of fear:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Feeling detached from your body</li><li>Inability to focus and concentrate</li><li>Feeling a sense of stress</li><li>Lacking emotional control</li><li>A pending sense of doom</li></ul>



<p><strong>Physical symptoms of fear:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Flight response (running for safety)</li><li>Freezing up (inability to move)</li><li>Displaying violence</li><li>Clenching fists</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>



<p>Anxiety is a sense of vague apprehension. It can be difficult to know <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/diagnosis/">how to diagnose anxiety disorders</a>. It makes you feel unpleasant, negative thoughts and you often can’t understand why. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/causes/">What causes anxiety</a> is imprecise threats that may or may not have any foundation. It’s a general sense of dis-ease, like how you might feel when walking down a dark, quiet city street in the middle of the night.</p>



<h3>Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety</h3>



<p>Anxiety is believed to have evolved in humans as a mechanism for protecting us against threats that may not even exist. Overwhelming anxiety gives us warnings that something dangerous <em>might</em> be about to happen.</p>



<p>For instance, you might get anxious because you believe that you could be attacked by a bear while walking in the woods. However, there may be no bears for miles around you. Anxiety isn’t completely useless though, because there actually <em>could</em> be a bear nearby. Ultimately, anxiety can serve to help keep you alert but causes harm when it goes too far.</p>



<p><strong>Physiological symptoms of anxiety:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Trembling or shaking</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Tightness in the chest area</li><li>Upset stomach and nausea</li><li>Quick, shallow breathing</li><li>Chills or hot flashes</li><li>Rapid heart rate</li><li>Muscle pain</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Dizziness</li></ul>



<p><strong>Psychological symptoms of anxiety:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Inability to focus on conversations, tasks, or thoughts</li><li>Racing, negative thoughts</li><li>Sense of impending doom</li><li>Feeling overwhelmed</li><li>Constant worrying</li><li>Catastrophizing</li><li>Restlessness</li><li>Irritability</li><li>Fatigue</li></ul>



<p><strong>Physical symptoms of anxiety:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Inability to complete mundane tasks</li><li>Difficulty sitting still and staying calm</li><li>Drug and alcohol use</li><li>Being startled easily</li><li>Social withdrawal</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>How to Know if You Are Experiencing Fear vs Anxiety</h2>



<p>Fear and anxiety both cause similar co-occurring physiological, psychological, and physical symptoms. Though the symptoms can overlap, it’s not uncommon if you experience an independent, unique experience, either.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it can be challenging to tell the difference between fear and anxiety, especially when you’re actively having symptoms. Still, if you’re experiencing fear or anxiety (or both), it’s not likely that you’ll even be questioning the differences at that time.</p>



<p>The differences in symptom expression between fear and anxiety are centered on several factors, including:</p>



<ul><li>Your emotional &amp; mental capacity</li><li>Your available resources to help you cope</li><li>What event triggered your response&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In short, the difference between fear and anxiety are:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Fear </em></strong>starts very suddenly as a fight-or-flight response to a well-defined threat.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Anxiety </em></strong>onsets in response to an unspecified, possibly non-existent threat.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Working through and lowering levels of fear and anxiety are very similar. It’s about teasing out the stimuli that manifested those emotions. Understanding the stimuli reaction helps to define the next steps of working through those emotions.”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/minchung/">Talkspace therapist Minkyung Chung, MS, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>When to Seek Help</h2>



<p>Chronic anxiety and fear have both been linked to mental health conditions, including <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/generalized-anxiety-disorder-guide-signs-symptoms-treatments-what-is/">generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/">social anxiety disorder (SAD)</a>, panic disorder, and specific phobias like agoraphobia or arachnophobia.</p>



<p>The National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI) reports that an estimated <a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/May-2021/Anxiety-And-Fear-What-s-The-Difference">20% of adults</a> in the United States experience symptoms of anxiety conditions each year. Women are more likely to be affected than men.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re experiencing repetitive, worsening symptoms like the ones we’ve discussed here, and they’re beginning to interfere with your functioning and daily life, it might be time to learn about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/how-to-treat/">how to treat anxiety</a> or fear, as well as go in for a screening. You can reach out to a therapist or contact a doctor to start the process. Your doctor will review your medical history and try to discern a possible cause for your symptoms.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The two are so similar it’s hard to figure out what a person is struggling with at that moment. A mental health professional can help with learning the differences and the coping skills necessary to be successful in managing both fear and anxiety.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/minchung/">Talkspace therapist Minkyung Chung, MS, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>If a diagnosis is made, you&#8217;ll likely be referred to different <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/therapy-treatment-types/">types of therapy for anxiety </a>and fear such as <a data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/">online therapy</a>. Then, you can begin treatment and learn new coping skills to better control the chronic fear or anxiety you&#8217;ve been experiencing. You don’t have to let fear or anxiety take over your life. Get the skills and coping tools you need to overcome your fear and anxiety, and you’ll begin on the path to a healthy, rewarding life. </p>

<p>Waking up anxious in the morning, or waking up at night with anxiety is common for many people. Nearly everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and stress periodically. However, if your anxiety is affecting you daily when you wake up or causing incessant sleeping problems, it might become overwhelming to the point that you can’t perform routine activities like work and interacting with your family.</p>



<p>Here, we’ll look at some of the common symptoms of morning and sleep anxiety. We’ll explore some of the causes that can be contributing to you waking up early with a sense of dread about your day. We’ll also offer various calming techniques that you can use, beginning tomorrow morning, to decrease the frequency and intensity of waking up with anxiety every morning.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Why Do I Wake Up With Anxiety?</h2>



<p>Waking up with anxiety can put a real strain on your day. Right from the jump, you&#8217;re stuck feeling that heavy weight of stress and dread. Some common symptoms of morning anxiety are:</p>



<ul><li>Feeling like your day is doomed right from the beginning</li><li>Feeling fatigued, even though you just woke up</li><li>Feeling like you just can’t get out of bed</li><li>Difficulty focusing and concentrating</li><li>Rapid, shallow breathing</li><li>Rapid heartbeat</li><li>Perspiring</li></ul>



<p>So what causes the morning anxiety?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The natural response</h3>



<p>The most common theory about waking up with anxiety has to do with a stress hormone called cortisol. As a defense mechanism designed to protect us, our brain and body will naturally react to stress. Although we no longer face the types of threats our ancestors once did, stress results in our bodies and brains reacting as if we’re under attack.</p>



<p>Thus, when we’re stressed, we release more stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline causes the heart rate to increase, boosts blood pressure, and spikes energy supply. Cortisol is the primary stress hormone in the body. It acts to release more glucose into the blood and enhances the brain&#8217;s usage of those sugars to enhance alertness and prepare us to defend ourselves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527370/">Research</a> has shown that cortisol levels already surge in the morning for the first 30 &#8211; 45 minutes after waking. This is known as Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) and may increase morning anxiety.</p>



<h3>Stress</h3>



<p>The common demands of life, like taking care of your family, accomplishing a huge workload, paying the bills, and preparing for the future, are all stressors. The limbic system of your brain perceives stressors as threats, and that can make you feel anxious from the moment you wake up each morning.</p>



<h3>Substance abuse</h3>



<p>If you’re using or abusing drugs and/or alcohol, waking up with anxiety can be common. While substance abuse may not have <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325808#:~:text=Substance%20or%20alcohol%20use,-People%20already%20dealing&amp;text=Although%20substance%20use%20and%20alcohol,feel%20when%20they%20wake%20up.">direct links to anxiety</a>, it <em>is </em>known to increase <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/anxiety-symptoms-signs-guide-tips-what-is/">anxiety symptoms</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Relationship struggles</h3>



<p>Some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2950886/">studies</a> show that the energy in a relationship may affect how well you sleep at night and how rested and calm you wake up in the morning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Physical health problems</h3>



<p>If you’re dealing with a chronic health condition, it’s natural to be stressed. Anxiety is common for those who have heart disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma, hypertension, and other serious health-related issues. Waking up with anxiety in the middle of the night or in the morning can be common when you have a serious medical condition.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Financial stress</h3>



<p>Worrying about money is a normal stress for many adults. Especially if you’re financially insecure, waking up with anxiety about how or when you’ll be able to pay rent, buy groceries, or cover bills is not unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Mental health conditions</h3>



<p>Like our physical health, mental health conditions can weigh heavily on our psyches. Living with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-to-know-if-you-are-bipolar/">bipolar disorder</a>, <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/my-depression-is-getting-worse/">depression</a>, or another mental health disorder can result in heightened anxiety at all times of the day, even in the mornings.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you find yourself waking up feeling anxious, ask yourself what happened the night before? What were you thinking about before you went to bed? These questions can help you identify the cause of your anxiety.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/bisma-anwar/">Talkspace therapist Bisma Anwar, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>Fortunately, there are various techniques you can employ, beginning right now, that are known to alleviate morning anxiety symptoms. You can practice these daily upon waking and decrease the frequency and intensity of morning stress.</p>

<h2>6 Calming Techniques to Avoid Waking Up with Anxiety</h2>



<p>Wondering how to stop waking up with anxiety? You’re not alone. Let’s review some techniques that have been found to help many people wake up more confidently, calm, and energetic, ready to face their day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though you might not be able to <em>totally </em>prevent the feeling of anxiety you experience when you first wake up, you can help lessen the symptoms and severity with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/natural-alternative-treatments/">natural remedies for anxiety</a>. Try using any or all of these methods right away.  </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“There are many ways to help calm your anxiety. You can do a guided meditation, do yoga or a workout, engage in a deep breathing exercise, have a healthy breakfast, listen to relaxing music, take a walk, or write a journal.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/bisma-anwar/">Talkspace therapist Bisma Anwar, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<h3>Change your diet</h3>



<p>The foods and beverages we choose to consume have an effect on our mood and functioning. Neurotransmitters, hormones, and other biological chemicals are all synthesized in our bodies based on the nutrients (or lack thereof) we get through our diet.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322652">Studies show</a> certain foods are associated with anti-anxiety effects. These include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Brazil nuts</li><li>Eggs</li><li>Pumpkin seeds</li><li>Chamomile</li><li>Yogurt</li><li>Turmeric</li><li>Dark chocolate</li><li>Fatty fish like mackerel and salmon</li></ul>



<p>Consider adding more of these foods in your daily diet to help your mood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, you might want to watch your intake of caffeine and other stimulating substances. If you&#8217;re already prone to anxiety, caffeine might exacerbate those symptoms. A glass of warm lemon water or decaf tea with honey in it may not be as exciting as that strong cup of coffee, but it can definitely be more calming.</p>



<h3>Meditation &amp; deep breathing (pranayama)</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/mindfulness-meditation-definition-guide-benefits/">Mindfulness meditation</a> offers many benefits to improve emotional and mental health. You can do it anywhere, without any equipment or memberships. Most communities have group meditation courses and support available. There are several different meditation styles, each having benefits for anxiety. Even just five minutes of meditation or deep breathing daily can have measurable benefits.</p>



<h3>Leave the television off &amp; opt for music</h3>



<p>Repetitive exposure to negative stories like what we see and hear in the mainstream media these days has been <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/13/4720">linked to increased anxiety</a>. If you don&#8217;t like the silence in the morning, try putting on some calming music to create a more relaxing environment. Remember, “calming” doesn&#8217;t have to be the same for everyone. You might prefer classical music, jazz, acoustic…try whatever is soothing to you.</p>



<h3>Exercise</h3>



<p>There are several various ways that daily exercise helps to alleviate anxiety, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30032703">Diverting your attention</a> from what&#8217;s making you anxious</li><li>Activating executive functions in the brain</li><li>Decreasing muscle tension</li><li>Altering brain chemistry</li></ul>



<p>Regular exercise <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254619300298">builds up resources</a> in the body that help increase resilience to erratic emotions. Exercise actually <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28319590">changes your brain chemistry</a> by increasing the availability of neurochemicals that work against anxiety, including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, various endocannabinoids, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).</p>



<h3>Journaling</h3>



<p>Taking a few minutes each morning or at night just before bed to jot down your thoughts can help to calm your mind and focus your thoughts. If you’re journaling in the morning, try tracking your dreams from the night before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solidifying your relationship with yourself is an excellent way to decrease anxiety. Doing so can help you stay in touch with your goals and aspirations and spot negative emotions creeping up on you as they occur.</p>



<h3>Create a morning routine</h3>



<p>Develop a realistic routine for your mornings, and then stick to it. Having a schedule helps you stay focused on your goals and avoid distracting thoughts and actions. It can also let you feel more steady, which can reduce anxious feelings that might stem from a feeling of being out of control. Additionally, knowing you have a routine to wake up to in the morning might help you stop waking up with anxiety in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has wreaked havoc across the globe for a solid two years now, and the toll it’s taken on us isn’t purely in regards to our physical health.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“At the beginning, it was alluring to work from home and complete a project wearing yoga pants and sipping tea, but the inability to socialize and go out created depressive symptoms due to the change in routine and lack of in-person interaction with others.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>In hindsight, it&#8217;s no surprise that the pandemic triggered mental health issues. The impact that living through a pandemic has had on our collective mental health is staggering. Whether you’ve tested positive, a friend or family member has caught it, or you’ve lost a loved one to COVID-19 — even if you’re just struggling as a result of the last two years — if you’ve found yourself more stressed, anxious, or a little depressed, hear this: <em>you’re not alone. </em>What’s more, there’s help out there for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there’s one thing a global pandemic has taught us, it’s that we’re better together. Read on to learn how COVID <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/depression/">depression</a> may be impacting your mental health and to learn what you can do about it.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“COVID-19 and depression are highly correlated. Some people experience depressive symptoms when diagnosed, others due to having to stay home to protect themselves, and some individuals have to deal with both being sick and at home.”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Depression in COVID-19 Patients &amp; Survivors</h2>



<p>Whether you were recently diagnosed with COVID-19 or are one of the COVID 19 survivors, the depression you may be experiencing is not uncommon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s important to understand that things are not “normal” right now. Everything we’re going through during the pandemic has altered many aspects of our lives, which can be difficult for some people to process. Couple this reality with an actual diagnosis, and the stress and pressure can feel overwhelming at best, devastating at worst.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The changes involved are causing depression following COVID-19. Some people started to call it the “new normal,” but in reality, it was a set of new behaviors, thoughts, and expectations, and like most changes, it has been difficult to adapt to this change.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<h3>Is depression a side effect of COVID-19?</h3>



<p>Though more studies need to be done to determine the long-term effects of depression due to COVID-19, some <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2777421">research</a> is showing staggering results. In fact, <em>more than half (52.4%)</em> of people surveyed reported moderate to severe symptoms of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/what-depression-feels-like/">major depression</a>, even several months post-recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It can be described as a side effect of COVID-19, but not everyone experiences it. Those individuals that have never felt depressed or who have the tools to deal with the symptoms of depression are less affected by it.” &#8211; <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a></p>



<p>There seems to also be a link between the severity of COVID and depression. The same study found that those who suffered more severe symptoms during their bout with COVID are more likely to report depression symptoms after recovering from the virus. Further, COVID survivors seem to be more likely to report other mental health conditions as well, including:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> symptoms</li><li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</a></li><li>Insomnia (or “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/coronavirus-insomnia/">Coronasomnia</a>”)</li><li><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/">Anxiety</a></li></ul>



<h3>What is causing depression following COVID-19?</h3>



<p>While research continues, there are two ways it’s currently thought that COVID-19 can have an impact on mental health, including issues related to both:</p>



<ul><li>Our immune response to the virus</li><li>Psychological stress stemming from a COVID-19 diagnosis</li></ul>



<p><strong>Immune response:</strong> Part of what we think we know about COVID-19 infections is that in response to the virus, our immune system produces chemokines and cytokines, along with other inflammation-causing reactions. Higher levels of a specific cytokine — known as T-helper-2 cell-secreted cytokines — appears to be found in those with <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0402-6.pdf?origin=ppub">more severe symptoms</a> and cases of COVID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High levels of cytokines can result in, among a host of other complications, the following:</p>



<ul><li>A disruption in blood-brain-barrier</li><li>Inflammation (nerves)</li><li>Nerve transmission impairment</li><li><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.28964">Central nervous system</a> issues</li></ul>



<p>Each of the above conditions are directly linked to various mental health conditions, like depression. Additionally, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-19-depression#1">research</a> has also linked elevated systemic immune-inflammation levels to major depressive disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Psychological stress: </strong>Multiple psychological factors seem to play a part in depression during COVID. High levels of sleep disturbances, PTSD, anxiety, and depression have been commonly <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/covid-19-depression#1">reported</a> during and after COVID infections. These may all be the result of stress-related to:</p>



<ul><li>Psychological reaction to contracting a potentially deadly virus</li><li>Social isolation and confinement&nbsp;</li><li>COVID-19 stigma</li><li>Guilt or fear of spreading COVID to others</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>COVID-19’s Impact on Mental Health</h2>



<p>Even if you haven’t contracted COVID-19, the toll the pandemic has taken on many people’s mental health cannot be denied. We’ve all been impacted on some level. Whether it’s fear for yourself<s>,</s> or worry for your kids and others, surviving the COVID-19 pandemic is something the majority of people seem to be struggling with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’ve experienced depression due to COVID-19 and related to any of the following, you’re not alone. Any of these can be factors that might be contributing to depression, anxiety, or a host of other mental health conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Fear of getting sick</li><li>General trauma about a deadly virus</li><li>Loss of a sense of community</li><li>Grief from the loss of a loved one</li><li>Grief about missing milestones and major life events</li><li>Loss of access to caregivers and basic medical needs</li><li>Food insecurity or housing insecurity</li><li>Additional financial concerns</li><li>Loss of a job or fear of a loss of a job</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“As a therapist, I started to see the correlation between depression and COVID-19 in April 2020, when people realized that staying at home was no longer a benefit, but an obligation. The idea of not being able to see their family and friends or even go have dinner at a restaurant created feelings of sadness and, in some cases, severe depression that exacerbated throughout 2020 and 2021.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a>.</p></cite></blockquote>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>How to Deal With Depression from the COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>



<p>Depression during COVID statistics have <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2770146">increased substantially</a>. Some research shows that the prevalence of depressive symptoms increased in every category of participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The link between disrupted mental health and the pandemic is clear. This just confirms that research must continue if we’re going to combat further potential mental health consequences of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, there are several things you can do to reduce depression from COVID-19. If you’re struggling with mental health as a result of the pandemic, try any of the following self-help techniques. Each can be good for both your mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Maintain a healthy diet and hydrate: </strong>Eating healthy and drinking enough water can do wonders for the body and mind.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stick to a healthy sleep schedule:</strong> Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule is important and can result in reduced anxiety and depression, better ability to focus, and increased energy levels.</li><li><strong>Get outside for fresh air and sunshine: </strong>While it&#8217;s hard, given the situation, even a few minutes in the sun can help with mood stability.</li><li><strong>Workout:</strong> Working out increases your endorphins, which are known to improve mood, reduce stress, and help you manage anxiety and depression.</li><li><strong>Limit (or avoid altogether) tobacco, drugs, and alcohol:</strong> Though often seen as an escape, relying on drugs, alcohol, and tobacco can actually increase stress and anxiety.</li><li><strong>Limit your screen time:</strong> Grab a book instead of your phone the next time you have downtime. Too much screen time can increase anxiety and disrupt your sleep.</li><li><strong>Practice mindful meditation, yoga, or tai chi:</strong> Ancient practices like meditation, yoga, and tai chi are all known to be an effective mental reset and can do wonders for managing depression. Try downloading a meditation app or subscribing to a workout platform that offers yoga or tai chi programs.</li><li><strong>Keep a routine:</strong> Whether you realize it or not, your body and mind both thrive from a routine. You don’t need to be rigorous about it, but making an effort to follow some sort of schedule, especially in the days of remote work, can help pull you out of depression.</li><li><strong>Avoid social media and news media:</strong> We live in a time where doom scrolling is a favorite pastime, and it can be hard to avoid. However, nothing good comes from overexposure to social and news media these days. Take a break from both and instead try journaling, going for a walk, or meeting a friend for coffee.</li><li><strong>Set priorities and stick to them: </strong>We all do better when we have priorities in place. Though there is <em>some </em>freedom in having a go-with-the-flow attitude and lifestyle, setting priorities in terms of what’s important can help when you fall into bad habits that may be contributing to your depression.</li><li><strong>Keep yourself busy:</strong> If you struggle with having downtime, pick up a hobby or have something on hand to do when you’re bored. Reading, knitting, going for a jog, or journaling are all great ways to occupy your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Focus on positivity: </strong>The power of positivity is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814782/">proven</a>. Use mantras, gratitude checks, or journals to keep your mindset positive and let go of the negative.</li><li><strong>Practice random acts of kindness:</strong> Studies show that doing nice things for others helps improve our mood, too.</li><li><strong>Make personal connections: </strong>Part of the struggle with depression from COVID-19 &nbsp;comes from isolation. If you find that being alone is impacting your mental health, make an effort to make or reestablish personal connections with people in your life.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Seek therapy:</strong> If you just can pull yourself out of your depression, it might help to talk to a therapist or doctor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“You are not alone. Thousands of people are dealing with depressive symptoms caused by COVID-19. Look for ways to feel better such as journaling, staying connected to those you love, and talking to a professional who can guide you.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC, CFTP</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<h2>When It’s Time to Seek Help</h2>



<p>Times are tough right now, and despite anxiety and stress being a normal reaction to any difficult phase of life, there comes a point when it might be time to get help.

<p>It’s been a difficult couple of years. People are experiencing anxiety about <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/anxiety-macro-micro-level-impact/">macro events</a> including everything from political stress, to social, racial, and justice battles, to a global pandemic — and now, we’re grappling with a war abroad. So, if you’re feeling a heightened sense of anxiety about war today, we can assure you, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>War anxiety could be expected any time great conflict occurs in the world, but given the fact that <em>this war</em> in particular is happening during one of the most collectively stressful times in recent history, it makes sense if you feel like you’re struggling a bit more lately. Whether you&#8217;re scared about the Ukraine conflict or the idea of a World War III, your distress, fear, and anxiety are valid.</p>



<p>With the right tools and information, however, it <em>is </em>possible for you to learn coping techniques to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-to-deal-with-anxiety/">deal with anxiety</a>. The tips below can be useful if you’re feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and anxious about the looming uncertainty and fear that often comes with war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep reading to learn more on how to deal with anxiety about war.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>1. Limit Social Media</h2>



<p>Social media can be a great way to keep in contact with family and friends. It can all but eliminate the long-distance barrier relationships once suffered from. Like everything else in life, though, too much of anything can have a negative impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re like most people out there, you probably have a morning routine that includes checking your social accounts within seconds of your eyes opening. While this might be a habit that’s difficult to break, be careful about what you’re allowing yourself to be inundated with on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/misinformation-disinformation-effect-mental-health/">Misinformation</a>, negativity, and abusive discourse have unfortunately become the norm across virtually every major social platform. Overexposure can result in major anxiety and stress, even about specific topics like war. If you&#8217;re finding that your social media usage is negatively impacting you, consider limiting how much time you spend scrolling each day. Look for ways to reduce your <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/managing-social-media-intake-without-quitting/">social media intake</a>.<br></p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Commit to a time period (IE: 30 minutes a day, or 15 minutes per session)</li><li>Set a definitive number of click-throughs you allow yourself (IE: 5 articles, or 3 sites)</li><li>Limit the sites you connect with</li><li>Delete apps or platforms you find most stressful</li><li>Mute or unfollow profiles that add to your anxiety about war</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>2. Be Mindful About Over Consumption of News</h2>



<p>We all want to be informed, but with the 24-hour news cycle, it can be easy to get lost in bad news, especially about the war. Smartphones alert you via notifications and pop-ups about each recent traumatic event. You have 10+ news channels pushing out constant programming, literally any time of the day or night. Newsletter emails are delivered on the hour, around the clock. “Breaking” news is available any time you want to find it.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Find ways that work for you to stay informed about the war and current events that don’t also trigger your anxiety symptoms so much and make you feel overwhelmed (ie: perhaps turn off your news notifications, and then instead, check the news when it feels right for you).&#8221;</p><cite><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>Be mindful of how much you allow yourself to become sucked into the news each day. Setting limits on how much you’re exposed to can be helpful, particularly if you have anxiety about war-related information.</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Give yourself a time limit on how much news you’re getting each day&nbsp;</li><li>Pick programs you trust and record them&nbsp;</li><li>Mute alerts during your workday so you’re not receiving constant interruptions</li><li>Delete apps that give you anxiety or increase your fear</li><li>Take a break from any news sites that you find distressing</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;If, however, you’re living with someone who wants to have the news on all the time, and you know that increases your anxiety, consider communicating your needs. Find a solution that helps you both to stay informed while also allowing you to stay as mentally well as you can at this time.”</p><cite><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>3. Fact Check</h2>



<p>Digital access makes finding information simple. Fortunately, it also allows you to fact-check sources and information. While this can be a slippery slope, and it can be easy to go down that proverbial rabbit hole, a quick fact check on alarming or concerning information can be a great way to keep your anxiety in check.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be aware of clickbait (shocking or catchy headlines that are used to entice you to click on an article). Take the time to ensure quotes are in context, facts aren’t being embellished, and headlines aren’t intentionally misleading. You’ll find this is a useful skill even when it’s not a time of war.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Check and verify credentials</li><li>Assess bias</li><li>Check dates</li><li>Read “About Us” sections</li><li>Analyze URLS — .edu and .org domains are typically valid, but if there’s a “lo” or a “.co” at the end, you should be leery</li><li>Trust your gut — if something sounds sensational or unbelievable, it might be worth doing a little digging</li><li>Use authoritative and trustworthy fact checking sites like:<ul><li><a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/">FactCheck.org</a></li><li><a href="https://www.politifact.com/">PolitiFact</a></li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/">WaPo Fact Checker</a></li></ul></li><li>Use a browser extension for alerts and notifications on suspicions sites and organizations:<ul><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/know-news/bmlfbcipfpdohbhhlkibdiacikbpaofm?hl=en">Chrome Know News</a></li><li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fake-news-detector/aebaikmeedenaijgjcfmndfknoobahep?hl=en">Chrome Fake News Detector</a></li></ul></li><li>Look for manipulated videos — Washington Post has a <a href="https://youtu.be/RVrANMAO7Sc">great video</a> on how to spot altered video content</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>4. Practice Self Care</h2>



<p>Self-care is essential and beneficial all the time, but it’s even more critical if you’re experiencing recent war anxiety. You can learn how to calm your mind and relieve major stress about the things you have no control over by using some very easy-to-follow techniques that encourage peace and structure in your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep breathing and relaxation exercises can help decrease anxiety symptoms. Deep belly breathing activates our parasympathetic nervous system response, helping to bring our bodies and minds out of that anxiety ‘fight or flight’ response and into a more relaxed ‘rest and digest’ response. It signals to your body and mind that you are safe. To practice this exercise, try taking three deep breaths, making your exhales a little longer than your inhales. Even if it only helps turn the ‘volume’ of your anxiety down from a 10 to a 9, taking small actions like this can support you in doing the next right thing, so that your anxiety is not the decision-maker, but rather, you are.</p>



<p>There’s a reason flight attendants instruct parents to put on their own oxygen mask first in the event of an in-flight emergency. Think of self-care like your oxygen — if you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t have the time, energy, resources, or ability to take care of anyone who needs you.</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Learn <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/meditation-science-eases-anxiety/">how to meditate for anxiety</a></li><li>Exercise</li><li>Listen to calming music or sounds</li><li>Diffuse essential oils</li><li>Get outdoors</li><li>Be mindful of your sleep schedule</li><li>Eat well&nbsp;</li><li>Stay hydrated</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Getting back to the basics is important when managing anxiety symptoms. Think about how you’re sleeping, if you’re drinking enough water, if you’re moving your body every day (if you’re able-bodied and can do so), eating well, etc. Sleep issues can often manifest as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6433686/">depression or anxiety symptoms</a>. Making sure you can get a strong foundation for your mental health by taking care of your basic needs as best you can is a good line of prevention for mental health conditions. Regarding eating well, consider your caffeine intake. Experiment to see how your anxiety symptoms are with that cup of coffee, and see how your anxiety symptoms feel if you switch to caffeine-free or decaf for a while (you might notice a decrease in anxiety symptoms, but everyone is different).” </p><cite><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>5. Learn Your Triggers</h2>



<p>Knowing what triggers your anxiety is step one in learning to manage it. If you know that you get riled up when looking at Twitter, avoid it. If a certain person’s posts on Meta ( formerly known as Facebook) stresses you out, mute or unfollow them. If a specific news program is constantly keeping you up worried about the war, think about taking a break or canceling the DVR recording for a bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning your triggers is a powerful way to take control of your life and your anxiety or depression. This is true during isolated times of stress (like a war) as well as when struggling with the stressors from normal, everyday life.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Take inventory of things that lead to severe anxiety about the war (and avoid them)</li><li>Notice if a specific activity is triggering you — like scrolling on social media or watching a certain program</li><li>Find things that give you a sense of control&nbsp;</li><li>Mute or delete apps that are triggering your war anxiety</li><li>Avoid conversations or spending time with people who add to your anxiety</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>6. Lean on Loved Ones</h2>



<p>Having a support system can be incredibly important if you’re finding it difficult to know how to deal with anxiety about war. Surround yourself with people who understand you, support you, and want the best for you. Anxiety can result in feelings of isolation, and spending time with people who love and care about you can be helpful.</p>



<p>Remember that you don’t need to <em>only </em>surround yourself with people who are like-minded. That said, realizing who you’re comfortable with might make it easier for you to share your feelings. Getting into combative conversations with people probably isn’t going to be the best for coping with war anxiety.</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Surround yourself with people you can trust</li><li>Don’t be afraid to open up and share your anxiety</li><li>Be honest if you want conversations to remain confidential</li><li>Don’t feel the need to label your feelings</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you’re a parent or guardian and caring for children or loved ones who are also feeling anxious, find age-appropriate ways of talking with them and supporting them through this. Then you’re not only coping with your war anxiety, but your entire home and community is also getting healthy ways to cope with this anxiety as well.” </p><cite><p> <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>7. Focus on the Positives</h2>



<p>The power of positive thinking has been proven in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760272/">scientific research</a> and studies. Particularly if you already struggle with anxiety, or if you’ve been previously diagnosed with an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/generalized-anxiety-disorder-guide-signs-symptoms-treatments-what-is/">anxiety disorder</a>, reminding yourself of the good things in life can be a powerful way to combat war anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simple acts that focus on the positives can help you manage anxiety about war stress that’s interfering with your daily functioning. One great way to manage anxiety can be to give back or find volunteer opportunities to donate your time and resources to.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you’re feeling helpless, but think doing something to help support victims of war might help your anxiety symptoms, look into ways that you can help that feel right for you. No effort is too small. See if doing something for others helps mitigate your anxiety in any way.” </p><cite><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>Rosenblatt offers the following ideas:<em>&nbsp;</em></p>



<ul><li>Make a monetary donation to an organization doing great work</li><li>Organize a food and clothing drive for your community that you can share with organizations delivering food and basic needs</li><li>Join a solidarity march or movement in your community</li><li>Talk with your kids about offering age-appropriate support to victims (for example, with younger children, you can ask if they want to draw pictures or write letters to people in war-torn communities)</li></ul>



<p>Giving back can make you feel good in times of hopelessness, but there are also several other ways to re-focus your mind on the positives.</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Physically list the people you care about and are grateful for&nbsp;</li><li>Keep a gratitude journal</li><li>Take the time to get outdoors and go for a walk&nbsp;</li><li>Set a time each day to recognize, enjoy, and appreciate the little things you might normally take for granted</li><li>Volunteer</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>8. Come to Terms with Uncertainty</h2>



<p>The unfortunate reality is there’s a lot of uncertainty in our world right now. Coming to terms with that, and accepting it, might help you get through your days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course you want to know what tomorrow holds — we all do. That feeling can be wildly amplified if you’re worried for the people who are directly affected by war and concerned about what the ultimate, final outcome might be. However, the simple truth is this: <em>you’re not in control of any of these things</em>. Allowing yourself to accept this idea can be game-changing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Make your health a priority</li><li>Take a break from news and negativity</li><li>Acknowledge and accept your emotions, but don’t let them take hold of your mental state</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>9. Consider Therapy</h2>



<p>Therapy can be an invaluable tool when you’re dealing with feelings of anxiety, worry, and fear. If you find yourself feeling more anxious than usually because of war anxiety, feel free to ask your therapist for more weekly sessions or more support if that feels helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let your therapist know how you’re feeling, and ask them for coping skills and ideas to help prevent and manage your anxiety symptoms. In <a data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/">therapy</a>, you learn that you don’t have to believe everything you think, especially anxiety thoughts that can be the worst-case scenario type or automatic negative thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning skills to identify these thoughts and ways to cope with them can be key to managing war anxiety. If you’re prescribed <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/medications/">medications for anxiety</a>, make sure you have enough and you’re taking them as directed.</p>



<p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Take the time to find a therapist you’re comfortable with</li><li>Be willing to put in the work — therapy isn’t always easy, but it is rewarding when you’re committed</li><li>Be patient — therapy doesn’t fix things overnight</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Soon to be published research in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) shows that if you’re feeling anxious, you can try an emotion regulation technique called ‘cognitive distancing’ to start feeling better. Cognitive distancing works by creating some separation between yourself and your feelings. One way to do this is when you’re feeling anxious, talk to yourself in the third person instead of first person. For example, instead of asking yourself “Why did I do that?” ask yourself “Why did &lt;your name&gt; do that?” Self talk matters for managing anxiety symptoms, and therapy by messaging seems to help with that.” </p><cite><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/kate_rosenblatt/">Talkspace therapist Kate Rosenblatt, MA, LPC, LMHC</a></p></cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Finding Support</h2>



<p>If you feel that your war anxiety is increasing or becoming something you can’t manage on your own, reach out for help with your mental health. You can talk to your doctor or find an <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/">online therapist</a> with Talkspace to help you find ways to deal with your anxiety. It’s normal to experience anxiety about war, but you don’t have to go through it alone.</p>

<p>We have all probably experienced the dread and anxiety that accompanies a return to “real life”&nbsp; after a wonderful vacation doing something that really fuels our souls. For many of us, the extreme transition can be difficult and we often find ourselves stuck with future angst rather than reflecting on positive memories or enjoying the here and now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many people believe that <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/manage-stress-vacation-return-how-to/">post-vacation stress</a> and depression are uncontrollable or to be expected. The good news is that with some healthy coping skills these feelings can be managed and we can get ourselves to a more optimistic viewpoint. First, it’s important to know what depression or depressive symptoms can look like, so you can better recognize when those coping skills are needed.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>What Can <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/depression/">Depression</a> Look Like?</h2>



<ul><li>Irritability</li><li>Too much or too little sleep</li><li>Eating too much or too little</li><li>Isolation</li><li>Lack of energy&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>We Can Regain Control, Which Decreases Symptoms of Depression</h2>



<p>Regaining control can be achieved in a variety of different ways, but we have to work hard to center our efforts around our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors rather than other people, places, or things. We don’t have much power over external items (triggers and stressors around us), but shifting our energy to an internal focus gives us the highest chance for success.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Examples of external focus:</h3>



<ul><li>Trying too hard to get other people out of their own depressive symptoms (focusing more on other people’s symptoms rather than our own, to our detriment)</li><li>Blaming work for being the reason behind our post-vacation depression</li><li>Allowing other people to contribute to our post-vacation depression</li><li>Comparing ourselves to others and feeling even more defeated</li><li>Letting the world determine our value rather than us feeling more in control</li></ul>



<h3>Ways to shift over to an internal focus:</h3>



<ul><li>Challenging thoughts that get us “stuck”— instead, consider what is within our power to change and what is out of our control</li><li>Allowing ourselves time to work through gut reactions</li><li>Making decisions with an objective viewpoint – look for facts rather than focusing on assumptions</li><li>Planning ahead to prepare for triggers</li><li>Building our internal locus of control by learning from challenging moments, applying the knowledge going forward, and rewarding ourselves when we succeed</li></ul>
</div></div>

<h2>Habits that Help Alleviate Post-Vacation Depression</h2>



<p>Habits are much harder to create than they are to keep. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/7-ways-to-build-selfdiscipline/">Creating new habits</a> is challenging because these new habits have to resonate for them to gain momentum and can quickly fall flat if they are not met with positive reinforcement. That’s why it’s so important to dabble with a few different habits to see what works for us.</p>



<p>These tips from our therapists about post-vacation habits can help you keep post-vacation depression at bay.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Helpful tips from our therapists:</h3>



<ul><li>Take an extra day off work, or come back a day early to start readjusting into your usual routine. This is a great time to tackle tasks like unpacking, cleaning, and grocery shopping which will help you feel more prepared for the week ahead</li><li>If possible, block an hour of your first day back to work on your calendar. Use this time at the start of your day to catch up on emails and to focus on your top priorities for the day or week ahead</li><li>Before leaving for vacation try to tidy up and cross some of your normal chores off your list— it will be worth it to avoid coming back to a mess </li><li>Set out your work clothes before you unpack so they don’t get mixed up in the clothing explosion that tends to take over your closet post-vacation</li><li>Defer unpacking until you have time to put everything away properly</li><li>Pack your lunch and work bag the night before so that you can just grab and go in the morning — you may feel more tired than usual the day after a vacation</li><li>Go to bed early or as soon as possible if returning late at night</li></ul>

<p>Since there are so many people that struggle adjusting after a vacation you can rest easy knowing you’re not alone and there are ways to manage feelings of <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/depression/">depression</a> and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/">anxiety</a>. That said, not all coping mechanisms are created equal. Focus on avoiding behaviors that only temporarily alleviate depression, since they can lead to an escalation of symptoms down the line. Instead, focus on creating functional habits that can be positively reinforced and maintained.</p>



<p>Most importantly, know that you can always access a professional if you are finding yourself paralyzed by negative coping mechanisms or if you are struggling to find ways to positively and successfully manage your post-vacation depression.</p>

<p>Valentine’s Day looks different for every couple, but whether you go all out or make plans to stay in, the goal is to have fun and connect more deeply with your partner.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for ways to <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/build-strong-relationship-habits/">strengthen your relationship</a> or just a new idea, we’ve got some unique (and simple!) Valentine’s Day suggestions for the Talkspace community from our partners at <a href="https://app.getlasting.com/?utm_source=talkspace&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=valentinesday#/quiz/demographics/0">Lasting</a>, the nation’s #1 couples therapy app.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>1. Plan an at-home picnic</h2>



<p>If you’re eating at home this Valentine’s Day, switch up your normal dinner routine. Cook up (or order in!) your favorite dish and make a picnic on the porch, balcony, or living room floor. If you prefer your dining table, break out the fine china to make it extra special.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, use this moment to discuss some new connection rituals you’d like to implement in your relationship. It could be simple things like drinking your morning coffee together, sitting down for lunch without your devices, walking around the neighborhood after work, or cocktails on the porch when the kids (or pets!) are asleep. When you form habits of connection during small, intimate moments, you create a foundation for consistency and trust for the long haul.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>2. Add questions to a fun activity</h2>



<p>This could be as simple as a puzzle or game! These activities free you up to connect through conversation while also alleviating some of the pressure by focusing your attention on a shared activity.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While you play (or eat or craft!), ask some open-ended questions using a question book or a quick internet search. These can be lighthearted, like, “What’s the best dream you’ve ever had?” but don’t forget about the deep stuff, too. Be vulnerable. Maybe, “If you could change one thing about your childhood, what would it be?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then ask your partner what they need most from you right now and then answer that question for yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Asking directly and honestly for what you need opens the door for your partner to meet your needs and for you both to feel more connected,” says Liz Colizza, lead couples therapist and the Director of Research &amp; Programs at <a href="https://app.getlasting.com/?utm_source=talkspace&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=valentinesday#/quiz/demographics/0">Lasting</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you need to, address these strange times directly. The COVID era has been hard on everyone. Identify the losses that have happened during this time. Name them out loud with your partner, because this helps you know how to support each other. Then, spend time examining what it would look like to show up for each other in big ways this season.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Liz Colizza, LPC, NCC</cite></blockquote>



<p>Being explicit about what you’ve both suffered or lost during this turbulent time can actually help alleviate some ambient anxiety and facilitate deeper connection.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>3. Try couple’s therapy or attend a relationship workshop</h2>



<p>Improving your relationship doesn’t have to be drudgery — you may learn about your partner in ways you never imagined. <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/couples-therapy/">Talkspace couples therapy</a> lets you rediscover the strengths of your relationship — and make it more meaningful than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re looking for more of an event, Lasting offers live and on-demand virtual workshops for couples that are hosted by licensed therapists. These experts will guide you through exercises to enhance your connection and communication. Workshop topics include rebuilding trust, healing conflict, and increasing desire. They even cover topics like how to have great date night conversation — perfect for Valentine’s Day!<br><br>The best part? All Lasting workshops are totally free for subscribers. <a href="https://app.getlasting.com/?utm_source=talkspace&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=valentinesday#/quiz/demographics/0">Get started</a> with 30% off and 7 days for free with your partner!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Set aside some time on date night to engage with one another with the help of a therapist and some guided questions. It will help make your night even more meaningful and will have benefits that could last for years.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>4. Do something new</h2>



<p>What’s an activity you’ve never done before as a couple? Maybe it’s hiking together, playing tennis, or wine tasting. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to learn to waltz (YouTube has a tutorial for everything!).</p>



<p>When you do something new, you learn new things about each other. And you might even gain a new passion together! Win-win.</p>



<p>Let this romantic holiday be the nudge you need to make new memories with your partner.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>5. Create new spaces together</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/valentines-day-ideas-quarantine/">Heart set on a date night in?</a> Change up your space by rearranging your furniture. Paint a room, hang new art on your walls, or add some greenery. Redesigning your space can give you a fresh outlook and a fresh environment to help connect in new ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while you’re hanging frames, maybe you could talk about your small successes from this past year. Even in the middle of a second pandemic year, you likely made progress. What are you most proud of?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Celebrating together increases connection and gratitude,” says Colizza, “So don’t forget to acknowledge the small accomplishments.”</p>



<p>(A champagne toast doesn’t hurt, either!)</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>6. Connect with your senses</h2>



<p>If your sex life has been affected by the stress of the past year, you’re not alone. Increasing intimacy is possible with care and intentionality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Many of us get stuck in our heads during sex and disconnect from the pleasure of the moment,&#8221; says Colizza, “To experience more connection, it’s important to intentionally tune into our bodies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How? Start by thinking about your five senses. What are some non-sexual things that are pleasurable for you? Perhaps it’s chocolate, music, or a soft blanket. Add some freshness to the bedroom by incorporating those elements that most please your senses. When you change the context, it can silence your inhibitions and increase your desire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, don’t forget that talking about sex is one of the best ways to increase your sexual satisfaction. Be open about what you want from your partner. Ask them about their favorite sexual experience with you and why they felt that way. When you&#8217;re vulnerable and open up, it encourages your partner to do the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Also, it’s a myth that only spontaneous sex is good sex,” Colizza adds, “Don’t be afraid to schedule sex, because it can actually increase anticipation and longing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plan ahead and prioritize this important part of your connection this Valentine’s Day!</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>7. Get creative</h2>



<p>Get in touch with your creative side! Make a new cocktail. Take a painting class. Bake dessert together. Sketch each other’s portraits or plan your spring garden. The options are endless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key is to have fun with it. While you’re creating together, talk about your favorite relationship memory from this past year. Discuss one <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/relationship-goals-partner-marriage/">positive relationship goal</a> you have for 2022 and share what you appreciate most about your partner. Use the creative time as an opportunity to share openly with each other.</p>



<p>This year, make your Valentine’s plans early and prioritize your emotional connection. Because no matter how you choose to spend the day, you can still ramp up the romance and make fun memories along the way.</p>

<p>To understand what narcissistic gaslighting is, you must have a basic and clear understanding of what both narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and gaslighting are individually. Not all people with NPD gaslight, but many do.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll define both NPD and gaslighting, describe what gaslighting is <em>not</em>, and list some signs that someone might be gaslighting you. Beyond that, we’ll also help you identify when a gaslighting situation or toxic relationship requires professional help.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember that not all people with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/how-to-set-boundaries-with-a-narcissist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narcissistic</a> personality disorder are gaslighters, just like not everyone who gaslights has NPD. Let’s look at each concept individually for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Narcissistic Personality Disorder Defined</h2>



<p>Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental health condition marked by a grand level of self-importance, an intense need for excessive admiration and attention from others, and a general lack of empathy for others.</p>



<p>People with NPD display extreme confidence while also being unable to gracefully accept even small criticisms or complaints.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Gaslighting Defined</h2>



<p>Gaslighting is the use of a patterned, repetitive set of manipulation tactics that makes someone question reality. It’s often used by people with narcissistic personality disorder, abusive individuals, cult leaders, criminals, and dictators.</p>



<p>It’s important to point out that gaslighting is a “patterned” behavior. It’s intentional and designed to make you question your memories and experiences.</p>



<p>Toxic people who gaslight instill confusion intended to make others rely on them. Convincing someone to question their reality gives a gaslighter a sense of power and superiority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite all this, gaslighting often isn’t so obvious. Many gaslighters may not realize they’re gaslighting, and many people who are being gaslighted also fail to recognize it at first.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What gaslighting is <em>not</em>:</h3>



<p>Gaslighting is not a single incident. When attempting to identify gaslighting, look for a pattern of behavior that appears to be both malicious and intentional. There are various instances when behavior may seem to be gaslighting but it’s actually not. Consider the following statements:</p>



<ul><li><em>“You’re misunderstanding what I’m saying. That’s not what I meant.”</em></li><li><em>“That’s not the way I remember things happening that day.”</em></li><li><em>“Ah, c’mon. What I did wasn’t </em><strong><em>that </em></strong><em>bad.”</em></li><li><em>“I didn’t intend for that to happen.”</em></li></ul>



<p>Many people will say things like this, but they’re not gaslighters in the true sense. If you want to spot gaslighting, look for a distinct, repetitive pattern of intentional malice or denial.</p>



<h3>What gaslighting can involve, but is <em>not</em>:</h3>



<p>Most people have experienced one or more behaviors commonly used as gaslighting tactics. Some of these forms of manipulation include:</p>



<ul><li>Bullying</li><li>Shaming</li><li>Intimidation</li><li>Name-calling</li><li>Emotional blackmail</li></ul>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Signs That You’re Being Gaslighted by Someone with NPD</h2>



<p>It’s common for people to fail to recognize manipulative tactics like narcissistic gaslighting. Someone with NPD might be gaslighting you if:</p>



<ul><li>You’re second-guessing your decisions more and more</li><li>You keep wondering if you’re being overly sensitive</li><li>You feel unstable or like you’re losing your mind</li><li>You unnecessarily apologize, often</li><li>You find you’re increasingly unhappy&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Narcissistic gaslighting can make you feel like something is wrong, but you’re unable to put your finger on just what it is.</p>



<h3>Common traits of gaslighters</h3>



<p>A toxic person who gaslights might:</p>



<ul><li>Refuse to consider your thoughts or concerns</li><li>Restructure past events to shift blame to you</li><li>Insist you did things that you know you didn’t do</li><li>Scoff when you share your side of the story</li><li>Tell others about your state of mind, behavior, or feelings<br></li></ul>



<p>A person with narcissistic personality disorder who’s gaslighting you might say you’re crazy, insensitive, or otherwise just flat out wrong when you try to express your needs or wants.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Examples of “Narcissistic Gaslighting”</h2>



<p>Narcissistic gaslighting examples can be subtle and difficult to recognize. It’s not the same thing as telling one lie, having a unique opinion, or accusing someone else of being wrong about something. It’s also important to note that someone who gaslights doesn’t necessarily have to know you personally.</p>



<h3>At work</h3>



<p>Sometimes coworkers can try to gaslight out of jealousy or anger about their (or your) position. For example, maybe you received a promotion and a coworker or your boss is angry about it. They may try to sabotage you in your new role, not giving you important information or messages. Maybe they move files you need or take documents you’re looking for. When you confront them, they might accuse you of being too stressed to be able to handle the position, or become angry in response, asking why you’d accuse them of such things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe at this point you start to really question your own capability in your new role. In some cases, you might even be dealing with a “<a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/6-ways-to-deal-with-your-narcissistic-boss/">narcissistic boss</a>.”</p>



<h3>People in positions of power</h3>



<p>People in power, like politicians, have been known to regularly gaslight the masses when they deny obvious recorded truths, such as authentic video recordings or testimony from multiple unbiased witnesses.</p>



<p>Sometimes these tactics can convince people that the politician did no wrong or that their behavior wasn’t really “that bad.”</p>



<h3>Medical care</h3>



<p>Some unethical doctors try to gaslight their patients by suggesting that health complaints are imagined or that pain is not as bad as they claim. They might go so far as to recommend counseling instead of other forms of medical treatment.</p>



<p>You might start to wonder if you truly do have the symptoms you’ve been explaining to your doctor. After all, doctors are the experts, the ones who went to school for years. You may think <em>of course</em> they know more about it than you do.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>In a relationship</h3>



<p>You’re convinced your abusive partner may have been unfaithful, but when you ask them about the physical or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/emotional-cheating/">emotional cheating</a>, they either flat out lie, tell you you’re crazy, or become enraged at the accusation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You have evidence and you vehemently disagree with their reaction, but you still find that you’re second guessing yourself. You question your belief that they aren’t being true and honest in the relationship. Getting out of a relationship with someone who has uses gaslighting can be challenging, but it <em>is </em>possible.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Why Someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder Gaslights</h2>



<p>People might gaslight others because of negative childhood experiences, a need to be in control, or due to a personality disorder like NPD. Regardless of the cause, all people who gaslight (not only those who show narcissistic behavior or with NPD) do so in effort to gain power. When narcissistic abusers or a gaslighter feels threatened, they feel a strong need for acceptance and support. They want others to believe their retelling of events to restore their sense of control.</p>



<p>Gaslighting can also be the result of someone believing that their account is more accurate than yours. By convincing you to question your memory of events, they can regain that sense of superior intellect.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Gaslighting, historically, is used to establish dominance. This is a key feature of someone who struggles with narcissistic personality disorder because the security of their lens depends on the other party being wrong.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/meaghan-rice/">Talkspace therapist Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<h3>Are gaslighters aware that they’re gaslighting?</h3>



<p>Some gaslighters are aware of their behavior, and they may even work to improve their gaslighting skills. They might enjoy the sense of superiority they feel from making others doubt their sanity and correctness.</p>



<p>Others who gaslight might not be aware that they’re doing it. Yet, unknowingly, they may continue to gaslight because of the payoff they get: a boost to life, confidence, and superiority.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>How to Deal with Gaslighting from Someone with NPD</h2>



<p>If you believe or know you’re being gaslighted, there are steps you can take to regain emotional control. For instance, you can:</p>



<ul><li>Talk about the situation with trusted loved ones</li><li>Find an <a data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" data-wpil="url" href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/">online therapist</a> to help you navigate your situation</li><li>Take notes directly after an argument or heated conversation</li><li>Learn how to set boundaries with a “narcissist” (this includes physical/emotional space)</li></ul>



<p>Over time and unaddressed, narcissistic gaslighting can wear you down and make you numb. It can cause you to be agitated and feel out of touch with yourself and your goals.</p>



<p>It’s important that you make time to take care of yourself and be intentional about reclaiming the energy that narcissistic gaslighting has depleted. Hold on to your sense of self and your belief system.</p>
</div></div>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>When to Seek Help</h2>



<p>Gaslighting for extended periods can decrease your sense of self-worth, cause anxiety and depression, and leave you unsure about the decisions you make. It can also cause a lot of loneliness if the gaslighter is your spouse or friend.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“When we start to question our safety or our livelihood, that is the time to get help from a licensed professional. For example, staying isolated from friends or family, workplaces, and/or schools out of fear for how the person with narcissistic personality disorder might react &#8211; that jeopardizes our safety and is a “red flag” to look out for.”</p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/meaghan-rice/">Talkspace therapist Meaghan Rice, PsyD, LPC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>Healing from narcissistic abuse can be challenging, but getting support from a therapist or someone else can help you recognize and effectively deal with the situation and begin taking steps to improve it. A therapist can help you address any doubts about your self-worth, deal with painful emotions, understand that you did nothing to deserve the gaslighting, and discover healthy new ways of coping with and escaping the situation.</p>



<p>Of course, a therapist can also work with couples who want to improve their lives together and completely eliminate any gaslighting that’s happening.</p>



<p>Dealing with narcissistic gaslighting can be daunting and confusing, but you can successfully survive an abusive relationship, set up boundaries, and protect yourself from the narcissistic abuse you’ve experienced. Use the narcissistic gaslighting checklist here to figure out if you’re being gaslighted by someone with NPD or show narcissistic behavior. Rely on the support you have in your life so you can get rid of the toxicity you’ve been dealing with if you’re being gaslighted by someone with NPD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You shoot awake from a dead sleep, sweating, heart racing, and short of breath. You have an awful sensation, but you’re not sure why. You feel a deep sense of dread as the walls close in around you. Are you dying? Are you having a heart attack? What is going on?</p>



<p>If this describes you, you might be experiencing nocturnal panic attacks (NPA). Having a panic attack at night can be terrifying. Understanding what we’ve learned about nocturnal panic attacks, including their symptoms, who’s most likely to experience them, and methods for treating and coping with them can help. Read on to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is a Nocturnal Panic Attack?</h2>



<p>Nocturnal panic attacks are episodes that shockingly and suddenly awaken you with strong emotions, mixed with uncomfortable physical sensations. They’re similar to panic attacks experienced when you’re awake but wake you up from your sleep. The episodes don’t necessarily physically hurt you, but they can be incredibly frightening and make you feel totally out of control.</p>



<h3>Symptoms of Nocturnal Panic Attacks</h3>



<p>Can you pass out from a panic attack in the middle of the night? Yes, you can. In fact, it’s one of the symptoms. A nocturnal panic attack can occur with no known trigger, and it can awaken you from sleep with potential physical anxiety symptoms, including:</p>



<ul><li>A feeling of being smothered&nbsp;</li><li>Shortness of breath</li><li>Feelings of confusion and desperation</li><li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness</li><li>Rapid heart rate or heart palpitations</li><li>Pain in the abdomen&nbsp;</li><li>Nausea</li><li>Sense of impending doom</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>Tingling&nbsp;</li><li>Numbness</li><li>Trembling and shaking</li><li>Hot flashes or chills</li><li>Feeling choked</li><li>Fear of dying</li><li>Sweating</li></ul>



<p>To be diagnosed with and treated for nocturnal panic attacks, at least four of the above symptoms must be present.</p>
</div></div>

<h2>What Causes a Panic Attack in Your Sleep?</h2>



<p>Researchers aren’t completely sure why some people have nocturnal panic attacks. It is known, however, that people who suffer from other types of panic disorders are more at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“It can be caused by several factors, from stress to over-worrying, but it varies from person to person.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC</a></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>While diurnal (daytime) panic attacks generally have identifiable triggers, you might not understand why you have a panic attack while sleeping. Experiencing a panic attack in sleep can be caused by a variety of factors, including:</p>



<ul><li>Underlying mental health conditions like <a data-wpil="url" href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/">social anxiety disorder</a> or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/depression/">depression</a></li><li>A family history of nocturnal panic attacks or panic disorder</li><li>A traumatic event like the death of a loved one</li><li>Imbalanced chemicals in the brain</li><li>A majorly stressful life event</li></ul>



<p>A panic attack in the middle of the night can be caused by any of the above possibilities, or a combination of more than one.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Multiple factors can cause it. Stress, nighttime rumination, over-worrying about what is pending the next day, and unresolved issues are amongst the main ones.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p><a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<h2>Who Might Experience a Nocturnal Panic Attack?</h2>



<p>Anyone can experience a nocturnal panic attack, especially people with panic disorder. Elevated stress and anxiety levels also increase the risk for a nocturnal panic attack. Others who may be at risk for nocturnal panic attacks include:</p>



<ul><li>People with a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea</li><li>Those with <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD)</li><li>People with general panic or <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/">anxiety disorder</a></li></ul>



<p>Nocturnal panic attacks don’t typically induce lasting physical harm. Other than the panic attack hangover, however, the psychological effects can linger for a long time.</p>

<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Treatment for Nocturnal Panic Attacks</h2>



<p>There’s no definitive cure regarding how to stop panic attacks at night. A nocturnal attack occurs without warning or apparent cause. It’s not currently possible to accurately predict when an NPA will occur, which makes research quite difficult.</p>



<p>However, there are some methods of treating and coping with nocturnal panic attacks that are known to help reduce their frequency and intensity. If you suffer from frequent panic attacks in the middle of the night, consider:</p>



<ul><li>Practicing mindfulness meditation and breath control</li><li>Using peaceful forms of exercise, like yoga and Tai Chi</li><li>Taking a hot Epsom salt bath before bedtime</li><li>Relaxing your mind and body with massage</li><li>Practicing self-affirmations before sleep</li><li>Talking with family and loved ones</li><li>Journaling</li></ul>



<p>All of the above are thought to help reduce the occurrence of night time panic attacks. However, if you find that your NPAs are affecting your life negatively, or occurring more frequently, then it might be time to seek professional assistance from a therapist.</p>



<p>There are several additional options known to reduce and help manage nocturnal panic attacks, including:</p>



<ul><li>Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines</li><li>Daily management techniques like relaxing, meditating, and exercising</li><li>A type of psychotherapy called <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/online-therapy/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/">cognitive-behavioral therapy</a> (CBT)</li></ul>



<p>The best treatment for nocturnal panic attacks is patient-dependent, but often involves a combination of CBT and prescription medications that can help reduce anxiety and stress.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“They can be treated the same way as anxiety and other panic attacks. With the help of a mental health professional who specializes in anxiety disorders or CBT, you can see good results in a relatively short period of time.” </p><cite><meta charset="utf-8"><p> <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/author/cynthia-v-catchings/">Talkspace therapist Cynthia Catchings, LCSW-S, LCSWC</a></p></cite></blockquote>

<h2>The Takeaway</h2>



<p>Although we’re not yet sure exactly what causes nocturnal panic attacks, remember that people with other types of panic disorders do have elevated risk. A medical condition like PTSD, chronic depression, high anxiety, and chronic stress are all believed to contribute to the occurrence of NPAs.</p>



<p>Anyone can experience a nocturnal panic attack. After waking up with jarring, uncomfortable physical and mental sensations, you might first think you’ve had a nightmare. However, nightmares, night terrors, and nocturnal panic attacks each have unique symptoms and are separate phenomena.</p>
</div></div>



<h3>Take the steps to minimize your nocturnal panic attacks</h3>



<p>There’s not one clearly defined, effective technique for totally alleviating or managing your nocturnal panic attacks. Not everything will work equally well for every person. However, there is some good news. The methods for treatment and coping we’ve discussed here can help you experience less intense, less frequent NPAs.</p>



<p>Some people completely cease having any nighttime panic attack after successful therapy and the continuation of self-management techniques. Others can decrease the number and intensity of the NPA episodes they experience.</p>



<p>If you believe you’re experiencing recurring nocturnal panic attacks, then begin practicing some of the centering, relaxing techniques outlined above. Especially in the evenings when you’re winding down and preparing for sleep, it can help to put your mind in a gentle state of relaxation, reducing the likelihood of having a nocturnal panic attack.</p>



<p>If self-management techniques don’t seem to be working for you, or if your NPAs begin to occur more frequently and are more severe, seek professional help from a therapist or another mental health professional. Learning to manage nocturnal panic attacks can help reduce your stress, ease your mind, and restore your energy.</p>
